# Professor Brett H. Meyer, PEng, PhD

<img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" width="25%" src="/assets/pictures/bhm.png">

Professor Meyer is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University. 
They received their Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Math, from the University of Wisconsin in 2003; 
their Masters and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005 and 2009 respectively.
After a brief appointment as a postdoctral researcher in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia, he joined McGill, in 2011.

Professor Meyer's research intersts are diverse, but tend toward computer system architecture, and design automation algorithms for embedded multiprocessor systems; and, 
fault-tolerance, manufacturability, and safety-critical system design.
Aerospace and automotive system cybersecurity, and hardware-software optimization of machine learning systems, are new areas of interest.
