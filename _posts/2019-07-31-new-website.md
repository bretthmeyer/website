title: "New website!"
excerpt: "Please bear with us as we move our website to Jekyll and slowly add content."

This summer we moved our website from WordPress to the [Jekyll Basically Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/) theme. Not everything is in place yet, but the new site should be a lot easier to manage than before!

Eventually, the new website will make it easier to see what research opportunities exist in the group, as well as information about past and present researchers. Stay tuned!
