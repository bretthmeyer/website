introduction: |
  The **Reliabile Silicon Systems Lab** (*RSSL*), in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://mcgill.ca/ece) at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca), conducts computer system optimization research targeting a wide variety of applications, from safety-critical automotive and aerospace systems, to machine learning on complex multiprocessors.
  
  Computer system design faces a multitude of challenges today, given the expectations of reliable high performance software, and low-power execution, on affordable hardware.
  RSSL is dedicated to the development of novel architectures and automation methodologies that support hardware-software co-design and optimization of heterogeneous multiprocessor systems. 
  [Recent topics](research/) include research on:

  * Computer architecture and automated computer system design
  * Fault-tolerant and safety-critical system design
  * Aerospace and automative system security
  * Hardware-software optimization of machine learning systems

  RSSL is directed by [Professor Brett H. Meyer](people/), who has more than 15 years of experience in research on the optimization of computer systems;
  the lab is supported by funding from 
  the [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)](https://www.nserc.crsng.gc.ca), 
  the [Fonds de recherche du Qu&eacute;bec (FRQNT)](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca), 
  and,
  industrial sponsors.
