The **Reliabile Silicon Systems Lab** (*RSSL*), in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://mcgill.ca/ece) at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca), conducts computer system optimization research targeting a wide variety of applications, from safety-critical automotive and aerospace systems, to machine learning on complex multiprocessors.
Computer system design faces a multitude of challenges today, given the expectations of reliable high performance software, and low-power execution, on affordable hardware.
RSSL is dedicated to the development of novel architectures and automation methodologies that support hardware-software co-design and optimization of heterogeneous multiprocessor systems.

RSSL is directed by [Professor Brett H. Meyer](people/), who has more than 15 years of experience in research on the optimization of computer systems;
the lab is supported by funding from the [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)](https://www.nserc.crsng.gc.ca), the [Fonds de recherche du Qu&eacute;bec (FRQNT)](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca), and industrial sponsors.
