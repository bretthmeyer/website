Interested in joining RSSL? We are currently looking for students at all levels (Undergraduate research assistants, Masters students, PhD students, or Postdoctoral research associates) with computer engineering backgrounds interested in:

- Aerospace and automotive system security, and
- Hardware-software optimization of machine learning systems.

_Note_: We do not conduct research on the transistor-level design of digital or mixed-signal systems.

If you feel your background is a good match for our current needs, please read this [excellent article](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/) on how to apply to graduate school before you [contact Professor Meyer](mailto:brett.meyer@mcgill.ca).

<!-- 
1. Apply to McGill University, and indicate ICS as your preferred research area.
2. [Email Professor Meyer](mailto:brett.meyer@mcgill.ca) and indicate (a) your McGill ID, (b) how your research interests relate to our needs, and (c) any relevant background or expertise you presently have.
-->

_Note_: We do not supervise summer research internships except in the context of the [McGill Faculty of Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering) [SURE Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research).
We also do not consider applications to the SURE program from students outside of McGill.
